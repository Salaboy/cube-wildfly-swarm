== Arquillian Cube running WildFly Swarm

Example setup of running https://github.com/wildfly-swarm/wildfly-swarm[WildFly Swarm] using https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-cube/#containerless-server-and-docker[Arquillian Cube Containerless] container.

Currently ShrinkWrap imports Maven generated '-swarm.jar' file and uses that as a source for the Docker image build. Maven Surefire is setup to skip normal test execution and only execute in 'verify' phase so we can make sure the '-swarm.jar' file has been created.

Future work:

* Create ShrinkWrap WildFly Swarm Importer

[source, java]
----
return ShrinkWrap.create(WildFlySwarmImporter.class)
   .loadPomFromFile(new File("pom.xml"))
   .importBuildOutput().as(JavaArchive.class);
----

Allow ShrinkWrap to generate Swarm file directly outside of Maven.
